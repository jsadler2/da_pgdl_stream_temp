Pseudo-code of DA-PGDL

1) Produce N-ensemble PRMS-SNTemp output based on drivers, parameters, and process error
2) Pre-train RGCN with N-ensemble of PRMS-SNTemp output
3) In forecasting period, (e.g. 2000-2010):
    a) Produce N state predictions from pre-trained RGCN at each time step (e.g. daily)
    b) If there are observations
        i)   Pass N state predictions of 2-3 different states, including an observed state (e.g. stream temperature) to the data assimilation scheme
        ii)  Update state predictions with DA
        iii) Pass updated states back to RGCN and update
    c) Run RGCN for next timestep, training the weights in RGCN and modifying loss function with state uncertainty from last timestep of the DA step
    d) Repeat
